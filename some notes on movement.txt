How many pixels per second does the walking player travel?

1 pixel per frame
How many frames?




player walks at a rate of (144/2.1) pixels per second.
= ~68

animation changes every 8 pixels. 
68/8=





WALK SPEED:
playerWalks = 144/2.1; // px per seconds
= !69

16 animations in 2.1 seconds 
ie. 1/(16/2.1)= 0.13125 changes per second


Instead of using 2.1 seconds, use frames per second.
This way the walk speed should scale even with frame drops,
or if I decided to run the game at, say, 30 fps.
