/*
Will be needing this example of how to set up animations in Impact:

// set up animated map tiles
var as = new ig.AnimationSheet( 'media/bg-flower.png', 16, 16 );
var as2 = new ig.AnimationSheet( 'media/bg-flower2.png', 16, 16 );
this.backgroundAnims = {
    'media/starter-towna.png': {
        // flower
        4: new ig.Animation( as, 0.26667, [0,1,0,2] ), // 16 frames out of 60 per
        1: new ig.Animation( as2, 0.26667, [3,5,3,4] ) // 16 frames out of 60 per
    }
};

index.php
-   Used for testing at the moment. For example, outputing Weltmeister maps.

inc.globals.php
-   Contains variables used in more than one place.

inc.functions.js
-   Contains JavaScript functions used in more than one place.

inc.functions.php
-   Useful PHP functions used in more than one place.

collisions.php - requires map images in the maps folder.
-   Use this tool to manage what collision type a tile will be.

animated-tiles.php - requires tilesheet image be in the maps folder.
-   Use this tool to manage which tiles are animated.

process-map.php - requires map image be in the maps folder.
-   Use this to generate a map JSON file, containing map width, height,
    and hashes for all its tiles.

dump-map-tiles.php  - requires map image be in the maps folder.
-   Use this to rip tiles directly from a map source image into a folder.
    Warning: time consuming.
    
merge-map-tiles.php - requires that map tiles be dumped.
-   Use this to combine all dumped tiles into a single tilesheet. A tilesheet
    image and a JSON are generated. The JSON contains hash information for
    each tile.

tilesheet-from-map.php - requires that maps are processed, ie. have a JSON file.
-   Reads map JSON files and from that generates a minimal tilesheet containing
    just the tiles used by that map (requires master tilesheet).
