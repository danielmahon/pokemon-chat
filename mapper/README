/*
Will be needing this example of how to set up animations in Impact:

// set up animated map tiles
var as = new ig.AnimationSheet( 'media/bg-flower.png', 16, 16 );
var as2 = new ig.AnimationSheet( 'media/bg-flower2.png', 16, 16 );
this.backgroundAnims = {
    'media/starter-towna.png': {
        // flower
        4: new ig.Animation( as, 0.26667, [0,1,0,2] ), // 16 frames out of 60 per
        1: new ig.Animation( as2, 0.26667, [3,5,3,4] ) // 16 frames out of 60 per
    }
};

inc.functions.php
-   Useful PHP functions used in more than one place.

collisions.php - requires map images in the maps folder.
-   Use this tool to manage what collision type a tile will be.

process-map.php
-   Use this to generate a map JSON file, containing map width, height,
    and hashes for all its tiles.
        (requires at least one map image be in the maps folder)

dump-map-tiles.php  - requires map image be in the maps folder.
-   Rip tiles directly from a source map image into a folder.
    Warning: time consuming.
    
merge-map-tiles.php
-   Combines all dumped tiles into single "master" tilesheet. Generates an image
    and a JSON file containing hash information.
        (requires all tiles to be inluded are dumped)

tilesheet-from-map.php
-   Reads map JSON file(s) and generates "minimal" tilesheet containing only
    tiles used in the map.
        (requires at least one map is processed, ie. has JSON file)
        (requires master tilesheet from which to extract tiles)
