trim.php
-   Lists all tilesheets within the maps folder and states whether or not
    they need to be trimmed. Added ?trim=yes to the browser window will
    enable trimming which is by default disabled.

collisions.php
-   Maintains collisions.txt, a collection of collision preferences. Choose
    which collision type tiles should be when opened in Weltmeister.

process-map.php
-   Lists all maps found in the maps directory, whether or not they have
    been processed (a JSON file has been generated for them). If one has not,
    the option is given to generate one.

used-tiles.php
-   Reads all existing map JSON files in the maps directory and from them it
    compiles an array of all the tiles that exist throughout the game world,
    which is stored as a JSON file used-tiles.js

dump-tilesheet.php
-   Lists all tilesheets found in the maps directory. You are given the option
    to dump the individual tiles of a specific tilesheet, or dump from all
    tilesheets at once. Warning: may be time consuming.
    
master.php
-   Creates a master tilesheet that contains every tile used by all maps in
    the maps folder. Before doing this, you must make sure that all maps
    whose tiles need be includes are first processed (see process-map.php).
