This is an experimental game/chat I created entirely in HTML5 and JavaScript
using the ImpactJS framework, with Socket.IO and NodeJS for the network
component, and a little bit of jQuery for the chat input.

The game can currently be played at this URL:

To run the server yourself, you must have NodeJS installed. If server.bat does
not work, you can drag server.js onto node.exe instead (does the same thing).
