This is an experimental game/chat I created entirely in HTML5 and JavaScript
using the ImpactJS framework, with Socket.IO and NodeJS for the network
component, and a little bit of jQuery for the chat input.

The game can currently be played at this URL:

To run the server yourself, you must have NodeJS installed. If server.bat does
not work, you can drag server.js onto node.exe instead (does the same thing).

To-do:
- Update map scrolling logic to allow any resolution, not just the current
- Fix "opening door" animation to include not just the final frame
- Add "closing door" animation when player exits a building
- Draw FPS to screen
- bubble.js: rename var 'from' to 'follow'
- Fix premature triggering of grass effect by network players
- Add support for signs to contain an accented 'E'
- Prevent user from spamming the action key to spawn unlimited bubbles
- socketClient.js: receiveSay method does not require client name
- Draw chat log to screen

Food For Thought:
- Furniture
- Player customization
